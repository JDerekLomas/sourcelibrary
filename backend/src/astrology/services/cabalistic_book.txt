First Section.\nOn the general attributes of primitive and cabalistic science.\n\nLong before the time of Moses, there existed among the Egyptians; among the Chaldeans and Arabs, a philosophy of numbers, to which they bestowed the splendid name Gabala, to thereby indicate that it was exalted above all sciences; for Gabala derives from the word Gibel, which means Exalted, and signifies a height. Actually, it was a symbolic doctrine of numbers.\n\nPythagoras had learned it from the Egyptians. The most famous sects of the Greeks possessed it. They were proud of it, especially the Platonists.\n\nThe master secret of this philosophy of numbers consisted in that it reduced and concentrated all objects to a unity by means of the number Three; then from it, by the same number, all
all diversities and progressive modifications, and thereby also the most correct harmony of the consequences derived *) B. E.\n\nIn the System of Creation.\nI.

Unitatis notam pro dato quolibet numero ita commutandi, ut nota talis respectu numeri esset exacté caracteristica, adeoqué ut in ipsa quasi distincte intueri liceret numeri rationem, quam ipse habet ad unitatem, quando eodem modo nota commutaretur in aliam, quem, quo ex data, ita in numerum Unitatis mutata fuit. notificandis numeris defectus non esset me-ita fine tantillo errandi periculo peragi tueretur, dendi rationes quaecunque.\n\n5\nNaturally, the philosophy of numbers had to select general formulas, through which it brought all sciences into comprehensible divisions common to all of them, in order to compare and evaluate them more easily. The formulas had to be symbolic and so precise that upon their first glance one received a sufficient explanation of the objects peculiar to each science.\n\nPythagoras was so famous among his contemporaries for this doctrine, and so honored by posterity, that long after Plato's time, a eulogy was sung about him in the following verses:\n\nMente Deos adiit, quidquid Natura negavit,\nVisibus humanis, oculis ea pectoris hausit.\n\nReducing all objects to 1 by means of the number 3 was the basis of the Pythagorean system of doctrine, or rather, of the primitive Cabalistic one: But to derive all diversities and modifications eccentrically from unity through the same number 3, it was necessary for him to use the opposite (or the oppositions), namely the Seventh number. From 1, the opposite was 7— from 3, it was 9— from 3, it was 9— from 4, it was 8— from 1, it was 11— from 6, it was 12.\n\nA 3\n\nThe
6\n\nThe average from 1 to 7\nfrom 2 to 8\nfrom 3 to 9 > Equation of\nfrom 4 to 10 > Forces.\nfrom 5 to 11\nfrom 6 to 12\n\nPerhaps this is also why the number 7 was a sacred number or sacred formula to the various peoples of the Orient; because they used it as a key to explain all sciences with their objects and their various modifications; for one finds:\nin their astronomy — 7 planets.\nin their natural history — 7 metals.\n— 7 main colors.\n— 7 main tones.\nin their ethics — 7 remedies for passions\nin their statecraft — 7 objects of administration,\netc.\nIt would have been interesting to see if the language alphabet could also have been reduced to 7 numbers. However, the multitude of objects made it impossible. It was set at 12.\nThis number was called completeness, or a mysterious number; because it corresponds to the base number 3 of the creation system, which divides itself into 4 trigons of the 12 celestial signs, and consequently to unity: 1 — 3 —\n4\n7\n12.\nThe\n\n7\n\nThe variation of the Δ trigons, the sight of the oppositions, of the commanded, of the presented appearances provided so much material for modifications, that by reducing the objects by means of the number 3, one arrived at unity, from which they had originated through the various modifications.\n\nThe first originator of numerical philosophy, who used the number 7 as a key to give a characteristic to all numbers above 10, from 11 to 99, or to make them symbolic, chose the characters of the 7 planets and arranged them as seen here.\n\nPlanetary Numbers or Number Characters.\n\nDirect Retrograde\nh | 12 | 21 | 34 | 43 | 67 || | 29 | 92 | 59 | 95 | 70\n4 | 13 | 31 | 35 | 53 | 68 || | 28 | 82 | 58 | 85 | 86\nMars | ♂ | 14 | 41 | 36 | 63 | 69 || | 27 | 72 | 57 | 75 | 96\nSun | ☉ | 15 | 51 | 37 | 73 | 78 || | 26 | 62 | 56 | 65 | 87\nVenus | ♀ | 16 | 61 | 38 | 83 | 79 || | 25 | 52 | 49 | 94 | 97\n☿ | 11 | 22 | 33 | 44 | 55 | 66 | 77 | 23 | 32 | 47 | 74 | —\n( | 17 | 71 | 39 | 93 | 89 || | 24 | 42 | 48 | 84 | 98\n☿ | 18 | 81 | 45 | 54 | — || | — | — | — | — | —\n☿ | 19 | 91 | 46 | 64 | — || | — | — | — | — | —\n\nAs
9\nSecond Section.\nCauses of these Attributes.\n\nThe ancients had an idea that numbers\nmust be sympathetic, because the number 9, which\ncloses the first decade from 0, has the peculiar\nquality within it that, with whatever\nnumber one multiplies it, it gives a result of 2 digits,\nwhich, added together, bring forth the nine\nagain; as:\n\n9)        2 gives 18\n9)        3 — 27\n9)        4 — 36\n9)        5 — 45\n9)        6 — 54\n9)        7 — 63\n9)        8 — 72\n9)        9 — 81\nLikewise in addition\n1)       8 — 9\n2)       7 — 9\n3)       6 — 9\n4)       5 — 9\n5)       4 — 9\n6)       3 — 9\n7)       2 — 9\n8)       1 — 9\n\n9\nTo find the sympathy of numbers, there is also\nno other means than to concentrate them and to reduce them to\nunits, that is, from 1 to 9, as\nhas been shown here in the addition.\n\nIf one considers the numbers displayed on the first table\nof each planetary character,\nand adds them, each individually, one will become aware of the pro-\ngression that the first originator of this arith-\nmetical game had, to determine the sympathy of\nnumbers thus and not otherwise.\n\nWhen the Egyptians, after many years of observations\nand calculations, had arrived at determining the peri-\nodic course of the planets around the sun, their\ndistance from the Earth, the difference in their diam-\neters and consequently their size and solidity,\nthey examined the weather temperatures observed according to their course or rather their\norbital stations in relation to the four trigons of the 12 celestial\nsigns. They designated with this name the\nfour seasons.\n\nSpring. Summer. Autumn and Winter.\n\nThey found that spring warmed what was cold,\nsummer filters, dries what\ngrows through warming,\nautumn brings corruption through moist-\nure,\nwinter freezes, cools, puts\ninto a state of inertia.\nA 5\nThey
Here\n10\nSo they named the trigons of the 12 celestial signs\nthe first ♈ ♌ ♐ Warm.\nthe second ♉ ♍ ♑ Dry.\nthe third ♊ ♎ ♒ Moist.\nthe fourth ♋ ♏ ♓ Cold.\nThey named the consequences of these effects\nCholera\nMelancholy.\nBlood.\nPhlegm.\nConsequently the deeds that arise from such qualities\narise,\nViolence.\nSlowness.\nHaste.\nLethargy.\nThe trigons, in which the 7 planets show their\naspects and each of them completes its orbit, must have naturally led them to the idea\nthat they assigned to the planets certain individual celestial signs corresponding to their slow\nor fast movement, and the effects consequently derived from them, as favorite regions. Hence it came\nthat they also assigned the planets the following qualities.\n♄ — Aratron — cold and dry\n♃ — Petor — moist and warm\n♂ — Phalee — warm and dry\n☉ — Och — warm and dry\n♀ — Hagith — moist and warm\n☿ — Ophiel — according to the nature of its neighbors\n☽ — Phul — cold and moist.\n\nLikewise\n\n11\nThey judged these very qualities in the elements\nEarth ▽ dry ▽ cold\nWater ▽ moist ▽ cold\nAir ∗ moist ∗ warm\nFire △ dry △ warm.\n\nAlways proceeding in this division of four,\nthey subdivided the Zodiac into the four Triplicities or Trigons — Fire — Water — Air —\nEarth. They called the first trigon the fiery one,\nnamely ♈ ♌ ♐. The second the Earthy ♉\n♍ ♑. The third the airy ♊ ♎ ♒. The\nfourth the watery ♋ ♏ ♓; because they formed triangles in the figure.\n☿\n\nfiery\nairy\nwatery\nfiery\n\nB\n\nairy\n\nThe
12\n\nThe Arithmetical Order of the Trigons of the Heavenly Signs was consequently this:\nin Signs in Names\nFiery 1. 5. 9 — ♈ ♌ ♐ Aries, Leo, Sagittarius.\nEarthy 2. 6. 10 — ♉ ♍ ♑ Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn\nAiry 3. 7. 11 — ♊ ♎ ♒ Gemini, Libra, Aquarius\nWatery 4. 8. 12 — ♋ ♏ ♓ Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces.\n\nThese triplicities must have been particularly striking to them because they had observed that the two outermost and largest planets ♄ and ♃, on their long journey through the Zodiac, always performed their conjunctions and oppositions for two hundred complete years in one and the same triplicity (without periodically doing so in another), and then also passed into another, to also carry out their conjunctions and oppositions in it for 200 years; similarly into the third, to do the same, and finally into the fourth, in order to return to the same point in the Zodiac where they had set out, after the completed number of conjunctions and oppositions.\n\nTo complete all four triplicities with their periodic conjunctions and oppositions, they (these two planets) required a full 800 years. The eight hundredth year, counted from their first conjunction, was called *annus magnus*, the great year, and in the astronomy of the ancients, *Revolutio magna*, the revolution of the great planets.\n\nEight\n\n13\n\nEight centuries, or the revolution through four trigons of these conjunctions and oppositions, were called by the Platonists *Tempus maximum*, greatest time —\nFour centuries, or the revolution through two trigons, *Tempus medium* —\nA quarter of the revolution, or the conjunctions and oppositions in one trigon, called *Tempus minimum*,\n\nThe observation made by the Egyptians in meteorology, that between 18 and 19 years, namely shortly before a conjunction or opposition of Saturn and Jupiter, almost the same weather conditions returned and the same winds appeared, spurred them even more to precisely understand the system of conjunctions and oppositions of Saturn and Jupiter. Precisely because of this meteorological study, the consideration of these conjunctions and oppositions of Saturn and Jupiter is also not unworthy of our attention; I present an essay on them to my esteemed readers at the end of this [work].\n\nMany years of observations had fully convinced the ancient Egyptians that Saturn, due to its slow pace, required almost 30 years to traverse the 12 signs of the Zodiac. Jupiter, however, needed 12 years to complete the same path; consequently, in a period of 30 years, he had already completed two and a half revolutions before Saturn had completed one. In the time that Jupiter traverses them,
Saturn covers only 5 signs, and before it has visited 3 of them, Jupiter has already moved 8 signs further, and thus in the twentieth year meets Saturn again in a sign of the trigon, which they have for 200 years for the case of conjunctions and oppositions. Therefore, in the 20th year, an opposition or conjunction occurs, for example, in the year of the world 3918 a conjunction, 10 years thereafter an opposition, 10 years after that again a conjunction, and then in the following 10th year again an opposition.\n\nIn precise calculation, they amount to 19 years, 313 days, 16 minutes, 13 seconds, 49 thirds of a day, consequently only 52 days are still missing from the 20th year.\n\nThe distance of an opposition in the Zodiac is 8 signs, 2 degrees, 58 arcminutes, 11 arcseconds, 29 arcthirds. These ordinary ones (for there is no talk of the extraordinary) always fall in the middle between 2 ordinary conjunctions.\n\nExtraordinary conjunctions of both planets, which repeat several times in a month or in a year, are not considered here, but only the twenty-year ones.\n\nThe great revolution of both planets, which occurs in the eight-hundredth year, and indeed at the point where the first happened, amounts, according to precise calculation, to 794 years, 48 minutes, 12 seconds, 28 thirds of a day.\n15\nThe progression of the conjunctions in degrees is each time, for every 30 degrees, slightly less than 2 arcminutes.\n\nThus, after every seventh conjunction, a change in the calculation occurs, so that for the seventh, instead of 20 years, only 19 years must be counted; and because 26 days are missing between the 10-year calculated distance between each conjunction and opposition; it follows that after ninety conjunctions, a good one must follow in the same trigon.\n\nBoth because of the above-mentioned meteorological observation, and for the knowledge of the sublime calculation in the universe, I have appended, at the end of this treatise, the table of all conjunctions of Saturn and Jupiter from the beginning of the world until our time, and somewhat later.\n\nAccording to the expression 'annus magnus', which was attributed to the revolution of both planets after 800 years, it would consequently be no absurdity to say that the globe on which we vegetate is currently only 7 ¼ years old.\n\nAlso for modern astronomers, the sublime order of the greater conjunctions and oppositions of Saturn and Jupiter is a majestic spectacle.
It was remarkable to the less enlightened Egyptian, Greek, and Roman philosophers for no other reason. They had observed that the greatest revolutions, which fate causes to occur here below, mostly happened around the time of a conjunction or an opposition of Jupiter and Saturn.\nFor this reason, I have appended the history of the world in short excerpts to the said table, so that one can judge to what extent these observations of the ancients hold true.\nHow much importance they attached to the operations of Saturn and Jupiter, the following stanza of Horace to Manenutas is proof:\nJup. Te Jovis impio tutela Saturno\nRefulgens, eripuit volucrisque fatis\nTardavit alas.\nAnd in the same place this one:\nSeu Libra Seu Scorpius aspicit\nFormidolosae partis violentior\nNatis horæ, vel Tyrannus\nHesperiae Capricornus undae.\nThey imagined that those countries, for which a conjunction or opposition of Saturn and Jupiter was vertical, would be particularly exposed to revolutions, changes, and extraordinary events. In doing so, they considered whether the planets were in alignment with the more prominent fixed stars in the zodiac,\nsuch as the Pleiades, the Heart of the Lion, its Tail, the Sickle of Virgo, the Heart of the Scorpion; then they thought the effect of the conjunctions and oppositions must be stronger.\nLikewise, they thought that when the conjunctions and oppositions occurred in the northern signs ♈ ♉ & ♎ ♏, their effect would be more perceptible to northerners than to others living towards the south; whereas the latter would feel the effect more than the former when the conjunctions and oppositions of the two greater planets occurred in the midday signs A ♒ ☿ ♏ and ♑.\nIt is not our task here to examine the error and prejudices of the ancient philosophers; but rather only to investigate how they, after a laborious collection of many years of observations, arrived at the idea of judging the origin, growth, flourishing, decline, and downfall of monarchies and states based on the calculation of the conjunctions and oppositions of Saturn and Jupiter in the four different trigons.\nIn the presentation of the trigons given on page 11, one sees the fiery, airy, and earthly trigon opposed to the watery one.\nThe
18\nThe midpoint of line A. A. and that of line B. B. was considered by these philosophers to be the dividing point of the forces of two planets in opposition.\n\nThe observation that in the fiery trigon during the 260 years in which Saturn and Jupiter made their conjunctions and oppositions therein, the greatest revolutions occurred on Earth, affecting the religion and government of peoples, led them to ascribe the most powerful effects to it; to the earthly trigon, however, events of long duration; to the airy trigon, those of short duration; and to the watery trigon, the most unstable ones.\n\nFor example, the Assyrian Monarchy began in the first third of the third earthly trigon: a sign that it would last long.\n\nThe theme was consequently this:\nIts greatest size in the\nairy\n\nits beginning in the ▽\nearthly\n\n△ the division of the\nempire in the watery\n\n△ its downfall in the Fiery\nIts duration was 1690 years.\n\n19\nThe Persian Monarchy began with an opposition of ♄ and ♃, when the former was in Virgo and the latter in a house of Saturn, in the Ⅹ. This constellation, they said, signified a short duration. The Persian Monarchy also lasted only 200 years; it only reached the ☐ and went under in the airy △, when Alexander conquered the last Darius.\n\nThe Macedonian or Greek Monarchy began in this △, whose events were estimated to be of short duration, and also lasted no more than 300 years, reaching its end with the victory that Pompey gained over King Perseus in the watery trigon.\n\nThe ancient Roman state began with the third opposition of Saturn and Jupiter in the fifth fiery trigon. Then Rome was built by Romulus. In the fifth earthly, this state obtained a changed form of government, and it became a republic. In the fifth watery trigon, the republican constitution was overthrown, when Julius Caesar defeated the Pompeians. The state gradually became monarchical. In the sixth fiery △, it was divided into the Western and Eastern empires. In the sixth airy △, the Western part, and in the seventh watery, the Eastern part of it perished. In general, the fiery trigons were very favorable to this state — in conquests and its enlargement — but the earthly ones through B 2 defeats
Dispositions and loss are unfavorable, but the airy ones are full of inner unrest and rebellions.\n\nConcerning the Ottoman State, the philosophers posed the following theme.\n\nIn 1800 years, its downfall\nFiery\nEarthy\nWatery\n\nIts weakness\nIts strength\nAiry\n400, greatest size\nof the Turkish state\n\nThe meteorological conclusions drawn from the observation of the conjunctions and oppositions of Saturn (♄) and Jupiter (♃) were the following:\nAttention was paid to those planets and stars that are closest to them in a conjunction or opposition, and their properties were examined, e.g., Mars (♂) in the signs Aries (♈) and Scorpio (♏) indicated arid or dry years. Proof of this is the conjunction of Saturn (♄) and Jupiter (♃) that occurred in Aries (♈) in the year 1782, which was preceded by a very hot summer. However, if the nearest planet is Venus (♀) or the Moon (☾) in the signs Cancer (♋), Scorpio (♏), Pisces (♓), Virgo (m), or if it is Mercury (☿), then great dampness, foul air, and a cooling of the earth will precede the conjunction or opposition.\nIf Mars (♂) is in a fiery sign or close to one, terrible thunder and hailstorms will result.\nIf Venus (♀) is near them in an earthy sign, earthquakes will occur; if it is near them in an airy sign, strong winds will come.\nIf Mars (♂) and Venus (♀) meet close to an opposition, murders, thefts, and betrayals will occur.\nIf Mars (♂) and Venus (♀) are close to an opposition, there will be many unfortunate deliveries, many premature births.\nThe scholars focused on observing the effects that the air temperature had on individual people, animals, and plants during or between the oppositions of Saturn (♄) and Jupiter (♃), depending on whether these occurred in the fiery, earthy, airy, or watery trigons, with a distinction in sensation for choleric, melancholic, sanguine, and phlegmatic constitutions.
See page 22\n\n1. These same researches led them to knowledge of Uranology (knowledge of air and the heavens), Geology (knowledge of the earth), Lithology (knowledge of stones), Hydrology (knowledge of waters), Pyrology (knowledge of fire), Botany (knowledge of plants), Anthropology (knowledge of humans), Ornithology (knowledge of birds), Quadrupodology (knowledge of quadruped animals), Ichthyology (knowledge of fish), and Chemistry.\nCold, dry properties, where they found them, seemed to them to merit being assigned to h.\nMoist and warm to 4,\nseething and dry to ♂, and so forth, to the remaining five planets, those which harmonized with their temperature already described above.\n\nThe various modifications of these temperature types gave rise to the assignment of special symbolic numbers to them, which, ranging from 11 to 99, were allocated to the 7 planets, as we have previously shown, undoubtedly with the intention of assisting the student in the Cabalistic science through local memory.\n\nA sympathy was attributed to these numbers, concerning which a special study also exists.\n\nBefore that, we wish to present the symbolic doctrine of numbers in tables. Here it follows.\n\nThe

Here it follows.
23\nThese were the general abstractions of the meanings of numbers.\nOne then proceeded to the meanings they were supposed to have in the various branches of natural history; namely:\nMeaning of metals and minerals — of colors — of smell — of taste — of places and regions — of animals — of the dispositions of people — of professions and the contingencies of human life — of human illnesses and their cure — of the processes of chemistry — of industrial arts — of the sublime sciences — of hidden things.\nThe reason why no number under 11 and none over 99 was used symbolically was presumably this: because, as we will show further below, only 3 numbers arranged in a trigon were selected, and their sum 10 was concentrated, so that it yielded a sympathetic number, which indicated the planet that was to give the decision.\nFor example, the trigon contained the numbers 25, 45, 64. Summed, they yield the number 134, which was called the key. Now it was concentrated, and one said 4 and 3 make 7. — 3 and 1 make 4. Together 47; consequently 47 is the harmonic, which, when concentrated yet again, gives 11 as a sympathetic [number] — and which, if one proceeds with it in the same way, gives 2 as a planetary number, namely Jupiter's, which indicates acquisition.\nThe following tables give particular meanings.\n\nB 4\nMes

Fourth Section.\nAccording to this knowledge, they presented the\nCabalistic Alphabet\nto the apprentices.\n\nJust as they had concentrated the numbers from 11 to 99 and assigned them to the 7 planets, they also found it necessary to reduce the speech alphabet to 12 consonants. They omitted the vowels and arranged it thus:\n\nb | e | d | f | g | l | m | n | r | s | x | y\np | k | t | v | h | | | | z | chs | z\nw | q | | ch | | | | | | | |\n\nThey assigned a number to each of these consonants. The numbers they chose for this were:\n\n10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30 | 35 | 40 | 45 | 50 | 55 | 60 | 65\n\nThe Cabalistic script was consequently without vowels; the reader had to mentally insert the vowels.\n\nTo\n\nIn the times of the Romans, when Cicero lived, this way of writing was called Tyronian, because Tyro, Cicero’s body servant and secretary, used it to write as quickly as his master dictated. For example, Cicero dictated: Si vales bene est, ego quidem valeo. Tyro wrote it down as: S vls bn ft g qdm vl.\n\nThe Cabalists wrote all their questions in the same way.\n\nComposition of Questions.\n\nTheir rule was that all possible questions, concerning human affairs and events, as well as general occurrences and scientific subjects, had to be formulated as briefly as possible and defined as clearly as possible, while everything inessential had to be omitted.\n\nFor example, What age will A. Sturmseder reach?\n\nThis question was written as:\nW—10 | I—35 | R—10 | S—55\nl—35 | t—20 | t—50 | t—20\nch—30 | r—50 | d—20 | t—50\n— | — | — | m—40\n75 | 105 | r—50 | f—25\n| | ch—30 | d—20\n| | n—45 | r—50\n— | —\n255 | 265\nS | Then
Then they combined the obtained sums into a main sum.\n75\n105\n255\n160\n265\n860\n\nThe main sum of the entire question now became the basis of a quarter, which consisted of 16 compartments. Into the bottom four, they arranged the main sums backwards, namely:\n\n| A | G | H | B |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| E | L | M | F |\n| C | I | K | D |\n|   | 8 | 6 | 1 |\n| 4 |   |   |   |\n\nNote. In their symbolic numbers, as seen above, there is no zero. If their result yielded a zero, they transformed it into the number 1. –\n\nIn long questions, it happens that the main sum yielded four digits. They then placed the thousands digit into the first compartment of the base row. Because this compartment also, in cases where the main sum consists of only three digits, must be filled,\n\nthey halved the hundreds digit if it was an even number, or, if it was an odd number, they took the number 1. In the above example, the appearance was this.\n\n| A | G | H | B |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| E | L | M | F |\n| C | I | K | D |\n| 4 | 8 | 6 | 1 |\n\nFifth Section.\nFilling of the Square.\n\nThis filling occurred by extracting the square root numbers from the main parts of the question. The rule was this: 1. Into compartment A came the square root of the sum given by the baptismal or distinct name of the person in question.\n\nFirst Note. Each compartment can only contain a single digit, therefore, if the surname had three digits, one must cut off the first two from the last, and where it has four digits, the first two from the last two. From the first two cut-off digits, one now extracts the square root. For example, in the question presented above, for example, is Ioseph. This surname has a sum of 160. One cuts
Page 116.\nOne cuts it off thus 16|0; and then one obtains 26, to extract the square root 4. It comes into Compartment A.\n\nSecond Note. Questions may arise concerning things that are not personal, such as: From which components is iron composed? Instead of the family name, the word 'Eisen' (iron) is used here, and instead of the generic name, the word 'Metall' (metal) is taken. Iron, after its conversion into the cabalistic alphabet, has a sum of 100; a zero cut off, 10 remains; the square root of 10 is 3.\n\nTo facilitate the teaching method, we therefore append the table of square roots and square numbers here.\n\nInto Compartment B came the square root of the family name, consequently in the first example, Sturmfeder, in the second, Metal. In the first, the word Sturmfeder has the sum 265. Cutting off the last digits from the latter, the first two digits give 26. Of this, the square root 5 is entered into Compartment B. In the second example, the word Metall has the sum 130. The first two digits, with the zero cut off, give 13; its square root is 3.\n\nThe Numbers.\nPage 116\nSquare roots.\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n8\n7\n62\n63\n8\n16\n77\n78\n79\n80\n9\n93\n94\n95\n96\n97\n98\n99.

Instead of the\nword Iron is taken here, and instead of the genus-name the word Metal. Iron has\nafter the translation into the cabalistic alphabet the\nsum of 100, one zero cut off, remains\n10, the square root of 10. is 3.\n\nFor the convenience of the readers\nthe table of square roots and square\nnumbers is appended here.\n\nInto slot B. came the square root of the\nfamily name, consequently in the first example, Sturm-feder,\nin the second Metal. In the first, the\nword Sturmfeder has the sum 265. The first\ntwo digits, cut off from the latter, give 26.\nThis is the square root 5. inserted into slot B.\nIn the second example, the word Me-tal has\nthe sum 130. The first two digits, after cutting off\na zero, give 13, the square root\nof which is 3.\n\nThe\n\nTable\nOf Square Roots and Square Numbers.\nPage 116\n\n| Square | Square\n| Roots. | Numbers. |\n| 1 | 1 | 2 | 3 |\n| 2 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |\n| 3 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 |\n| 4 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 | 21 | 22 | 23 | 24 |\n| 5 | 25 | 26 | 27 | 28 | 29 | 30 | 31 | 32 | 33 | 34 | 35 |\n| 6 | 36 | 37 | 38 | 39 | 40 | 41 | 42 | 43 | 44 | 45 | 46 | 47 | 48 |\n| 7 | 49 | 50 | 51 | 52 | 53 | 54 | 55 | 56 | 57 | 58 | 59 | 60 | 61 | 62 | 63 |\n| 8 | 64 | 65 | 66 | 67 | 68 | 69 | 70 | 71 | 72 | 73 | 74 | 75 | 76 | 77 | 78 | 79 | 80 |\n| 9 | 81 | 82 | 83 | 84 | 85 | 86 | 87 | 88 | 89 | 90 | 91 | 92 | 93 | 94 | 95 | 96 | 97 | 98 | 99 |
117\nThe appearance of the quadrilateral in the first example is\nthis:\nA | G | H | 5\nE | L | M | F\nC | I | K | D\n4 | 8 | 6 | I\n\nInto compartment C. came the square root of the\nsubject. In the first example, the subject is: What age: Therefore, the square root of the already preceding 105. and 75.\nthe square root of which is 4. Now the appearance of the quadrilateral is this:\n\n4 | G | H | 5\nE | L | M | F\n4 | I | K | D\n4 | 8 | 6 | I\n\nInto compartment D. came the square root of the\nverb. In the given example, it is called: will reach. Consequently, the square root of 25/5 goes in. The quadrilateral then appears like this.\n\nS 3\n4 | G
118\n4 G H 5\nE L M F\n4 I K 4\n4 8 6 I\n\nCompartment E was filled by means of adding compartments A. and C.\n\nLikewise, compartment F by means of adding compartments B. and D.\n\nIn the given first example, this operation shows:\n\n4 G H 5\n8 L M 9\n4 I K 4\n4 8 6 I\n\nCompartments G. H. were filled by multiplying the numbers in A. and B.\n\nLikewise, compartments I. K. by multiplying those in C and D.\n\nIn the given first example, this operation shows thus:\n\n4/2\n\n119\n4 2 I 5\n8 L M 9\n4 I 6 4\n4 8 6 I\n\nIt has already been mentioned above that if a zero appears in a result, instead of it, as here in the first row, 1 must be set.\n\nCompartments L. M. were likewise filled by multiplying the numbers in E and F.\n\nIn the given first example, this operation now shows the appearance of the completely filled square.\n\n4 2 I 5\n8 7 2 9\n4 I 6 4\n4 8 6 I\n\nFrom these numbers of the square, the doubled symbolic numbers for the theme are now made in the following way.\n\nThe first and second upper compartment gives — 42.\n— second and third upper — — 21.\n— third and fourth upper — — 15.\nThe\n3 4
120\nThe first and second of the second row gives 87.\n— second and third — — — 72.\n— third and fourth — — — 29.\n— first and second of the third row — 41.\n— second and third — — — 16.\n— third and fourth — — — 64.\n— first and second of the fourth row — 48.\n— second and third — — — 86.\n— third and fourth — — — 61.\n\nThese were then inserted into the theme with their\nsymbolic signs.\nIn the given example, the theme would have this\nform:\n\n86\n♄ ☿\n61\n♁ ☿\n21\n♄ ☧\n2\n☌ 69\n42\n64\n87\n☉ ☌\n72\n♂ m\nHere,\n121\nAfter this, they gave the teaching on how the Trigons\nhad to be ordered among themselves in order to derive\nthe consonants of the answer from their numbers, namely:\nthe Trigon of the house first, then the other Trigons in their order.\n\nIn the given example, the question is from the\nfirst house; the Trigons now follow one another as follows:\n\nFirst Trigon, the 1st House, 5th House, 9th House.\nSecond — — 2nd — 6th — 10th —\nThird — — 3rd — 7th — 11th —\nFourth — — 4th — 8th — 12th —\n\nConsequently, the arrangement is therefore:\n\nFirst △ 42 72 6\nSecond △ 21 29 48\nThird △ 15 41 86\nFourth △ 87 16 61\n\nThey transformed them into consonants of the\nalphabet by assigning that consonant to which\nthey came closest.\n\nAs, in the given first example.\n\nSee the alphabet:\n\nb | c | d | f | g | l | m | n | r | s | x | y\np | k | t | v | h | | | | | z | cs | j\nw | q | | | | | | | | | ch | chs |\n10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30 | 35 | 40 | 45 | 50 | 55 | 60 | 65\n\nand
122\n\nAnd note the initial values of the Trigons next to it.\n\nFirst ∆ 42 72 64\nSecond ∆ 21 29 48\nThird ∆ 15 41 86\nFourth ∆ 87 16 61\n\n45 10 65\n20 30 50\n15 40 10\n15 20 65\n\nFor the representation of a complete answer,\n24 such alphabetical numbers were required:\nBesides the 12 that had been obtained in the prescribed manner,\nanother 12 had to be extracted,\nand they were extracted from those, by means of a very\nsimple operation, namely: Plus 5. — Minus 5.\nor 10 Plus 10. and Plus 20. It matters not\nwhich row such a Plus or Minus is assigned to.\nFor the true rule of its use was this, that one\nprovided the consonants with their true harmony:\nIf three standing next to each other were from the\nlowest class of the alphabet, then one added Plus 20 next\nto them to raise those to be extracted into the middle\nor highest. If they were from the highest, then one\napplied Minus 5 or Minus 10 to them. Likewise, if\nthey were found mixed. However, it was not permitted to use\nother numbers for Plus and Minus than the aforementioned\n5—10 and 20, nor to omit any of them. Where a consonant\nrepeats itself twice in the result, it is permitted to\nincrease it by 10.\n\nProof.\n\n123\n\nLet us check this method using the given\nfirst example.\n\n1st ∆ 42 72 64\n2nd ∆ 21 29 48\n3rd ∆ 15 41 86\n4th ∆ 87 16 61\n\nSet. Next Consonants Min. 10. 35 10 55\n45 10 65 Plus 5. 25 35 55\n20 30 50 Plus 10. 25 50 20\n15 40 10 Plus 20. 35 40 25\n15 20 65\n\nThus we have obtained the consonants.\n\nn | b p w | v j\nd t. | g h ch | r\nc f q | m | b p w\nc f q | d t | r s\n\nl | l p w | r s\nf v | l | r s\nf v | r | d t\nl | m | f v\n\nNow it was important that the Cabalist properly\nplaced them according to the assessment of the theme,\nwhereby the following rules were to be observed:\n\nFirst Rule. In the answer for the first\nrow, no other consonants are allowed to appear than those\ndiscussed for it. Likewise in the answer for the\nsecond, third, and fourth rows.\n\nSecond Rule. Where there are triple\nor double consonants in a compartment, it is not necessary\nto bring all three or all two into the answer,\nbut it is enough if only one of the three, or
or one brought in by the two. We will attempt the transposition of the above consonants of the given first example, and thus work out 24 examples, whereby we will apply the following variation of languages: 1. in German, 2. in Italian, 3. in French, 4. in Latin, 5. in English.

He must adhere to the meaning that the three numbers of the Trigon indicate to him through their symbolic meaning. He must express the sense of this meaning through the consonants he obtains. Here too he is limited; for he can use no foreign ones, and of those that are present, he may omit none.\nR 3.\nFreiz
Freylick must possess knowledge of the subjects about which or concerning which questions are asked, insofar as he wishes to achieve the reputation of having answered nothing inappropriate — and from this it is recognized that the symbolic number theory or cabalistic science was a means to impart to the students extensive knowledge, and so to speak, a general overview of all sciences and their principles. For one can consider the present representation an arithmetic game that can entertain in solitude; sharpens the understanding, and indicates possibilities. It is always pleasant to see how here the Cabalist draws truth from a deep well. Six individual consonants of a line give extended sentences of 17 complete words, as was seen in the fourth example in the second line.\n\nThe\n\nThe Twenty-Year-Old\n\nConjunctions\n\nand\n\nOppositions\n\nof\n\nSaturn and Jupiter\n\nFrom the Beginning of the World until now.\n\nÆ 4
